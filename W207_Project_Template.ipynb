    "###Competition Description: the data and the goal\n",
    "This competition seeks to predict the forest cover type from strictly cartographic variables. The actual forest cover type for a given 30m x 30m patch was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data. Independent variables were then derived from data obtained from the US Geological Survey and USFS. The data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary columns of data for qualitative independent variables such as wilderness areas and soil type.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "The dataset was provided by Jock A. Blackard and Colorado State University, and is hosted by UCI machine learning repository.  \n",

    "The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. The goal is to predict an integer classification for the forest cover type. The seven types are:    \n",
